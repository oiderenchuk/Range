# Range
The current solution implements the logic described in the problem:
1) The data type in task is an Integer;
2) When the range intersects with the existing one:
- program combines the ranges into one
3) The logic of deleting a range implemented: 
Eg: AddRange(1,10)   // the element in container 
RemoveRange(3,5);    // result: (1,2) AND (6,10) 
4) In main.cpp: interface for the console
